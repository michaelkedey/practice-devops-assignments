7. Use the echo command to add a new line to the end of the file with the text "Appended line for practice." eg. echo "Appended line for practice." >> example.txt
8. Use the sed command to replace the word "practice" with "manipulation" throughout the file. eg sed -i 's/practice/manipulation/g'
9. Use the cp command to make a copy of example.txt named example_backup.txt.
10. Use the sed command to remove the second line from example_backup.txt eg  sed -i '2d' example_backup.txt
11. Use the wc command to count the number of words in example.txt. eg wc -w example.txt
12. Use a command to count the number of words in backup_example.txt.
